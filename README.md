# Practical-Work-1
This repo contains the Practical Work 1 of Aitor de las Heras, Miguel Montero and Luis Roll√°n.

Luis - I've created the principal folder for the project called Practical-Work-1 in order to add the .csproj and the Program.cs file with the main included. Also I've divided the classes in different files in order to make the program easier to read.
